# spotty-music-scrutiny
This module contains scripts that extracts my liked songs using the Spotify API and provides a visual analysis of my music.  

This module serves 2 purposes:  
1) Backs up the names of my saved songs, making it easer to recover in case of loss of data.
2) Fun side project to work with web API's and improve my tech skills.
